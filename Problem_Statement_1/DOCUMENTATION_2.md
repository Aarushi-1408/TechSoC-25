## Problem Understanding
**What the problem is asking:**  
The problem is to **break (decrypt)** a message that was encoded using the Caesar Cipher. Since the Caesar Cipher uses a fixed shift (1â€“25), the idea is to try all possible shifts until the correct plaintext is found.

**Key concepts involved:**  
- Brute force search  
- String manipulation  
- Character encoding and modular arithmetic  

**My approach:**  
Instead of asking the user for the key, the program tries **all 25 possible shifts** and prints the resulting text for each. By scanning the outputs, the correct message can be identified. This is possible because the Caesar Cipher is very weak against brute-force attacks.

## Conceptual Learning

### **New Concepts I Discovered**
- **Brute Force Cryptanalysis:**  
  A technique of trying every possible key until the correct plaintext is found. This shows why simple ciphers are insecure.  

- **Frequency Analysis (extension):**  
  Letters in English follow a distribution (like `E` being most common). Although not strictly implemented, this concept helps in improving Caesar Cipher breaking beyond brute force.  

- **Computational Thinking:**  
  Automating repetitive tasks (like testing all shifts) shows how a computer can solve problems humans find tedious.  

### **How I Applied These Concepts**
- I used a loop that ran from `1` to `25`, applying each possible shift to the ciphertext.  
- For each shift, the program displayed the "decoded" text.  
- The user can then recognize the correct message by reading through the outputs.  

### **Real-World Connections**
- **Cryptanalysis:** This brute-force approach demonstrates why modern encryption must use much larger keyspaces.  
- **Cybersecurity:** Understanding how weak ciphers are broken helps in appreciating strong encryption algorithms.  
- **Forensics & Puzzle Solving:** Breaking substitution ciphers is often seen in investigations, Capture the Flag (CTF) contests, or puzzle-based games.
